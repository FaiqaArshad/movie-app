1. List the movies in cards with: the title in bold, the category and a Youtube type gauge indicating the likes/dislikes ratio. The cards must be side by side and responsive. I.e. when the window is reduced, the cards jump to the next line.

2. Add a button in the cards allowing to delete it

3. Add a toggle like/dislike button

4. Add a filter by category (like multiselect) assuming we don't know them in advance (so we have to get them dynamically from the movies). If all the movies in a category are deleted, the category should not appear anymore.

5. Add a pagination system with the following features:

     Previous/Next buttons
     Choice of the number of items displayed per page (4, 8 or 12).

Take initiative, there are bonus points if

     It looks good
     You use REDUX correctly
     There is an attention to details
     Don't Remove the asynchronous behavior in movies.js .
